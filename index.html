        <h1>My Hobbies </h1>
        <h2>  My favorite hobby is art. Art is really fun to do for me I like to paint, I like to draw, and I also like to color. I like all types of art! </h2>

            <h3> Art has the power to educate people about almost anything. It can create awareness and present information in a way that could be absorbed by many easily. In a world where there are those who don't even have access to good education; art makes education an even greater equalizer of society. </h3>

            <h1> About </h1>
            <p> My name is Saadhana, I was born on September 12, 2011. I was born in Texas. I have 1 older sister who is 2 years older than me. Her name is Sahana. My favorite color is pink, and when I grow up I want to be an artist. I can write in both hands but its easier to write in my left hand. I write in my left hand but I do stuff like throwing balls and catching them in my right hand.
